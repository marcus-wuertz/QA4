## Cookeville Animal Mecical Clinic  
### About
Cookeville Animal Medical Clinic is a local veterinarian that, while cozy, is admittedly behind the curve technologically speaking. They have one veterinarian, Dr. Little, who despite being well over retirement age, stays with the clinic so that it can remain open. The clinic would have to find another veterinarian to replace Dr. Little if he were to retire because they have to operate under a veterinarian's license. Though the clinic has tried, they have not found a replacement for Dr. Little, so he stays with the clinic so that it can remain open for Cookeville residents and their pets. 

The Animal Clinic is quaint, with vast differences from what you would see in a clinic somewhere like Nashville. They have three clinic cats that roam the building freely all day. The clinic operates at a much slower pace, and does not see nearly the number of emergency patients as a busier clinic would. That said, the clinic has seen an influx of patients recently. As it turns out, dogs get allergies too! With a small staff, only one veterinarian, and an outdated record system, the clinic is having trouble juggling the number of patients that they see. 

Though some of the staff are comfortable with the current system of operations at the clinic, others note it's shortfalls. The clinic still operates on hand-written notes, a physical time clock, and several other outdated workplace practices. Despite staff suggestions to bring the clinic up to speed, the clinic still operates the same way it has for decades, making it difficult to manage the number of patients they're seeing. 

To overcome this issue, Cookeville Animal Medical Clinic will have to make some changes to the way their business operates, without compromising the environment that Dr. Little has created over the years. 

### Overview
## Business Problem:

Though the homely feel of the clinic is attractive to many of the older residents of Cookeville, the clinic does not operate efficiently. When someone comes into the clinic, they are greeted by the receptionist, who makes a note of the main complaints for the animal. Then, they are to sit in the waiting area until a nurse can come start the appointment. Due to the number of staff and the time it takes for each appointment, the waiting area is often congested. The waiting area is not very large, so backups can cause chaos due to impatient animals.

One significant contributor to these backups and time   needed per appointment is the physical documentation of patient records. It takes much longer to write down patient information as the owner is saying it to the technicians as opposed to an electronic system. Additionally, newer staff report difficulties effectively communicating everything the owner is saying, as well as difficulty understanding the shorthand the clinic uses. The staff also report issues reading Dr. Little's handwriting; apparently even animal doctors fit the stereotype. 

Physical records also contribute to low efficiency, as they must be located to lookup patient information. Physical notes also have an greater chance of being lost or damaged. Due to these concerns, many feel that an online note taking system would be an effective solution that would increase efficiency while retaining the environment of the clinic. 

While the clinic does utilize technology, their use of it is very bare-bones. Records do not have complete patient information, as that is kept in a physical log. The software manages sales, inventory, schedules, and contact information, but no real record of patient's visits or history. Staff reports that the software is not very intuitive and is inconvenient. However, if an application could connect these different bussiness functions, it would be much more efficient and cohesive. 

## Solution Overview
We plan to make a task management system for the clinic that will record patient records and histories, as well as all of the other information already collected by the current software. This system will centralize the clinic's functions and store them in a database that can be easily accessed. Not only will this streamline the clinic's appointments, but it also reduces human error by eliminating handwitten notes. This management system could potentially pose a huge benefit to the clinic, and outweighs the potential costs.

# Planning Phase
## Requirements
-The receptionist should be able to identify patients, verify their contact information, and note the chief complaint or reason for visit <br />
-Checking patients in on this page should notify either the tech or doctor, depending on which is needed for the visit <br />
-The application should allow techs and doctors to see and edit patient information <br />
-The application will also allow staff to see patient's history if they have any <br />
-The application will have a page for ordering prescriptions, previous allergies/medications will also be stored <br />
-Staff will be able to order prescriptions, surgeries, procedures, or check the patient out depending on the situation <br />
