## Cookeville Animal Mecical Clinic  
### About
Cookeville Animal Medical Clinic is a local veterinarian that, while cozy, is admittedly behind the curve technologically speaking. They have one veterinarian, Dr. Little, who despite being well over retirement age, stays with the clinic so that it can remain open. The clinic would have to find another veterinarian to replace Dr. Little if he were to retire because they have to operate under a veterinarian's license. Though the clinic has tried, they have not found a replacement for Dr. Little, so he stays with the clinic so that it can remain open for Cookeville residents and their pets. 

The Animal Clinic is a very cozy place, with vast differences from what you would see in a clinic somewhere like Nashville. They have three clinic cats that roam the building freely all day. The clinic operates at a much slower pace, and does not see nearly the number of emergency patients as a busier clinic would. That said, the clinic has seen an influx of patients recently. As it turns out, dogs get allergies too! With a small staff, only one veterinarian, and an outdated record system, the clinic is having trouble juggling the number of patients that they see. 

Though some of the staff are comfortable with the current system of operations at the clinic, others note it's shortfalls. The clinic still operates on hand-written notes, a physical time clock, and several other outdated workplace practices. Despite staff suggestions to change to an online record system, the clinic still operates this way, making it difficult to manage the number of patients they're seeing. 

To overcome this issue, Cookeville Animal Medical Clinic will have to make some changes to the way their business operates, without compromising the environment that Dr. Little has created over the years. 

### Overview
## Business Problem:

Though the homely feel of the clinic is attractive to many of the older residents of Cookeville, the clinic does not operate efficiently. The entire clinic runs on hand-written notes, which causes issues with staff being able to read the veterinarian's handwriting (apparently even animal doctors fit the stereotype). This also causes issues with efficiency, physical notes must be located to lookup patient information. Additionally, there are discrepencies in communication in the clinic, because not everything can be effectively written down in a short visit. Physical notes also have an greater chance of being lost or damaged. Due to these concerns, many feel that an online note taking system would be an effective solution that would increase efficiency while retaining the environment of the clinic.
